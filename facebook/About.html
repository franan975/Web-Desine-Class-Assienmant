    WHAT IS A STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (SIS)?
    A Student Information System (SIS) is a software application that enables a career college or postsecondary school to
    - Track and manage all student data, information, and progress
    - Run its teaching and financial operations
    
    Also referred to as a Student Records System (SRS), Student Management System (SMS), or Student Information Management System (SIMS), an SIS is a database that maintains a complete record of student activities, as the person moves from interested individual, applicant, and student, to a graduate who has been placed in a job/career, and eventually joins the alumni ranks.
